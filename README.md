## Project: Interactive Desktop Form Application

This project builds a desktop application with functionalities for managing form submissions.

**Features:**

* **Two Main Forms:**
    * **View Submissions:** This form displays existing submissions. It allows users to navigate through entries sequentially using "Previous" and "Next" buttons (with keyboard shortcuts). By default, the first submission appears initially.
    * **Create New Submission:** This form allows users to create new entries. It includes editable fields for:
        * Name
        * Email
        * Phone Number
        * GitHub repository link (URL)
    * This form also features a stopwatch with a button to pause and resume timing. The timer persists even after pausing.
    * A "Submit" button saves the new entry with the recorded time to the backend.

**Technical Specifications:**

* The application utilizes a two-form design for separate viewing and creating submissions.
* Navigation between submissions in the "View Submissions" form is facilitated by buttons and keyboard shortcuts.
* The "Create New Submission" form provides editable fields and a persistent stopwatch.
* Form submissions are expected to be handled by a separate backend system (not included in this project).

## Current Project Status

Work in Progress: This project is currently under development and not yet fully functional.
Backend Integration Pending: The application's backend functionality, responsible for handling form submissions, is not yet implemented.
Expected Functionality (upon completion):

Submitted data (Name, Email, Phone Number, GitHub URL, and recorded time) will be transmitted to the backend system for storage and retrieval.
Next Steps:

Development of the backend component to handle form submissions.
Integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between the frontend application and the backend system.
We appreciate your understanding!
